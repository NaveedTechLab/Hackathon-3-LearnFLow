# Prompt History Record

**Title:** Spec Phase 3 Backend Services
**Stage:** spec
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**ID:** phr-spec-phase3-backend-services

## Original Prompt

Create a specification for Phase 3: Backend Services with requirements for FastAPI-based services, Dapr integration, and specific API endpoints.

## Response Summary

Complete specification for Phase 3 Backend Services including:

- User stories for the backend services
- Functional requirements for FastAPI-based services
- Dapr integration specifications
- Specific API endpoint definitions
- Success criteria for the phase

## Specification Details

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to implement microservices using FastAPI so that I can leverage Python's ecosystem for rapid development
- As a system architect, I want to integrate Dapr for service-to-service communication so that we achieve loose coupling and resilience
- As an end user, I want consistent API responses so that client applications can reliably consume backend services

### Functional Requirements
- Implement RESTful APIs using FastAPI framework
- Integrate Dapr for state management, service invocation, and pub/sub messaging
- Define specific endpoints for core business functionality
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Implement proper logging and monitoring capabilities

### Dapr Integration Specifications
- Service-to-service communication using Dapr sidecars
- State management for persistent data storage
- Pub/sub messaging for event-driven architecture
- Secret management for secure configuration

### Success Criteria
- All defined API endpoints are implemented and tested
- Dapr integration is properly configured and operational
- Services meet performance and reliability requirements
- Proper documentation is provided for all endpoints
- Integration tests pass successfully

## Context
This specification is part of the broader Reusable Intelligence and Cloud-Native Mastery project, focusing on implementing backend services for Phase 3 using modern cloud-native technologies.
