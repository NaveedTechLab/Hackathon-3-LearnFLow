## Original Prompt
Generate a task list for Phase 2 based on the approved plan with specific tasks for deploying Kafka and PostgreSQL using skills, verifying pod status, and documenting endpoints.

## Response Summary
Complete task list with phases, dependencies, and implementation strategy was generated, covering:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy Kafka on Kubernetes using Helm chart
- Deploy PostgreSQL on Kubernetes using Helm chart
- Verify successful deployment of both services

### Phase 2: Service Validation
- Verify pod status for Kafka and PostgreSQL
- Test connectivity to deployed services
- Document service endpoints and connection details

### Phase 3: Documentation
- Document Kafka endpoints and topics
- Document PostgreSQL connection details
- Create deployment verification report

## Key Implementation Strategy
- Utilized available skills for Kafka and PostgreSQL deployment
- Ensured proper dependency ordering between tasks
- Included verification steps to confirm successful deployment
- Planned for proper documentation of all endpoints and configurations

## Dependencies Identified
- Kafka deployment must complete before connectivity testing
- PostgreSQL deployment must complete before connectivity testing
- Service validation must occur before documentation phase

## Outcome
Successfully generated comprehensive task list for Phase 2 infrastructure deployment with clear phases, dependencies, and implementation approach.
