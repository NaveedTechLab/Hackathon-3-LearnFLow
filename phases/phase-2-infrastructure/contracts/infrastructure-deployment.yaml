# Infrastructure Deployment Contract

## Purpose
Defines the contract for deploying Kafka and PostgreSQL infrastructure using skills.

## Deployment Steps
- Kafka: Execute kafka-k8s-setup skill
- PostgreSQL: Execute postgres-k8s-setup skill
- Verification: Run verify.py scripts from each skill

## Expected Outcomes
- Kafka pods in Running status
- PostgreSQL pods in Running status
- Services accessible within cluster
- Minimal success/failure output to maintain token efficiency

## Validation Criteria
- Both verification scripts return "Done"
- Pod status is Running for both services
- Endpoints documented in infra-endpoints.txt
